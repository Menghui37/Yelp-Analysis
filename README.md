# Yelp Data Analysis
## Analysis on Yelp's Business, Review and User data.

Yelp datasets(business, review and user) were obtained from Kaggle. Datasets were downloaded and uploaded on AWS s3 for AWS EMR access. A Spark cluster, yelp-cluster, and a Jupyter Notebook, Analysis, were created to analyze these datasets. Detailed analysis code and outputs can be found in Analysis.ipynb.
The following are screenshots of yelp-cluster and Analysis notebook
